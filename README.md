## redmine2github

Scripts to migrate redmine tickets to github issues.  This is for a 1-time move--so it's a mix of automation and manual decisions.  e.g., Get-it-done, but make the process repeatable.

### Setup with [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation)

* ```mkvirtualenv redmine_move```
* ```pip install -r requirements/base.txt```

### Make a config file

* Copy "/src/settings/local_sample.py to "/src/settings/local.py" and fill in variables
* Fill in your redmine and github credentials
    * For the Redmine API key, see ["You can find your API key on your account page..."](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api#Authentication)
    * For github, enter your credentials.
        (To do, use a [Personal API token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens))
        
### Workflow
        
#### (1) Download your open redmine issues

* Each issue is saved as a .json file, including relevant "children", "journals", "watchers", "relations"
    * The file naming convention is by ticket issue number.  
        * e.g. Issue 387 becomes "00387.json"
    * Files are saved to the following directory:
        * from settings/local.py:  (REDMINE_ISSUES_DIRECTORY)/(current date in 'YYYY_MMDD' format)
            * e.g. ../working_files/redmine_issues/2014-0709/(json files here)
                   ../working_files/redmine_issues/2014-0709/03982.json
                   ../working_files/redmine_issues/2014-0709/04050.json
* A json dict is saved to "issues_list.json" that maps the redmine issue number to the issue subject.  For example:
            * e.g. ../working_files/redmine_issues/2014-0709/issues_list.json
            
```javascript
    {
        "03982": "Create Genomics Metadata Block", 
        "04050": "Additional Astronomy FITS File Metadata Support for Units", 
        "04051": "Metadata: Astronomy - Changes to Ingest and Display of Resolution Elements", 
        "04072": "Edit Dataverse: Checking/unchecking use facets from Host Dataverse undoes any changes in the rest of the form."
    }
    
```

#### Example of downloading redmine issues

+ cd into the src/redmine_ticket directory
+ update the bottom of the "redmine_issue_downloader.py" file
+ Currently looks something like this:

```python
if __name__=='__main__':
    from settings.base import REDMINE_SERVER, REDMINE_API_KEY, REDMINE_ISSUES_DIRECTORY
    #rn = RedmineIssueDownloader(REDMINE_SERVER, REDMINE_API_KEY, 'dvn', REDMINE_ISSUES_DIRECTORY)
    rn = RedmineIssueDownloader(REDMINE_SERVER, REDMINE_API_KEY, 1, REDMINE_ISSUES_DIRECTORY)
    rn.download_tickets()
```

+ run it:

```
../redmine2github/src/github_issues> python redmine_issue_downloader.py
```



#### (2) Migrate your issues to a github repository


---

Note 1:  Once added, a github issue **cannot be deleted**.  Therefore, to test your migration, create a new "scratch" github repository.  Once you're satisfied that the migration works, delete the scratch repository.   

---


--- 

Note 2: The current [GitHub API limit](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/) is 5,000/day.  Adding each issue may have 1-n API calls.  Plan appropriately.

+ 1 API Call: Create issue with labels, milestones, assignee 
    + This process creates a json file mapping { Redmine issue number : GitHub issue number}
+ 0-n API Calls for comments: A single API call is used to transfer each comment
+ 2 API Calls for related issues (optional): After all issues are moved
    + Call 1: Read each GitHub issue
    + At the bottom of the description, use the Redmine->GitHub issue number mapping to add related issue numbers and child issue numbers
    + Call 2: Update the GitHub description


---        


#### Quick script

+ cd into the src/github_issues directory
+ update the bottom of the "migration_manage.py" file
+ Currently looks something like this:

```python
if __name__=='__main__':
    json_input_directory = os.path.join(REDMINE_ISSUES_DIRECTORY, '2014-0702')
    kwargs = dict(include_comments=True\
                , include_assignee=False\
                , redmine_issue_start_number=4123\
                , redmine_issue_end_number=4134\
                , user_mapping_filename=USER_MAP_FILE       # optional
                , label_mapping_filename=LABEL_MAP_FILE     # optional
                , milestone_mapping_filename=MILESTONE_MAP_FILE # optional
            )
    mm = MigrationManager(json_input_directory, **kwargs)
    # e.g. json_input_directory, where you downloaded the redmine JSON
    #      json_input_directory="some_dir/working_files/redmine_issues/2014-0709/" 
    #
    mm.migrate_issues()
```

+ run it:

```
../redmine2github/src/github_issues>python migration_manager.py
```




#### Label Map Notes

The label map is optional.  It allows you to assign label names and colors by creating a label map file.

+ See [Sample Label Map, sample_label_map.csv](https://github.com/IQSS/redmine2github/blob/master/src/settings/sample_label_map.csv)

---

+ The [**redmine_type** column](https://github.com/IQSS/redmine2github/blob/master/src/settings/sample_label_map.csv) is for user convenience only, it is ignored by the program.  So watch out for name collisions

---

+ Pertains to Redmine name values in fields **status, tracker, priority, or custom_fields**
+ If no map is specified in the [MigrationManager kwargs](https://github.com/IQSS/redmine2github/blob/master/src/github_issues/migration_manager.py#L127):
    * The status, tracker, priority, or custom_fields names in Redmine issues are made into GitHub labels.  See "def get_label_names" in the [label_helper.py file](https://github.com/IQSS/redmine2github/blob/master/src/github_issues/label_helper.py)
        * A Redmine status of "New" would turn into label "Status: New"
        * A Redmine tracker of "Feature" would turn into label "Tracker: Feature"
        * A Redmine priority of "Urgent" would turn into label "Priority: Urgent"
        * A Redmine custom field of "UX/UI" turns into label "Component: UX/UI"
    * If no map is specified, then newly created labels will not have a color

**Map Notes** - How is the map used?


+ The map is specfied in the [settings/local.py file](https://github.com/IQSS/redmine2github/blob/master/src/settings/local_sample.py#L32) under LABEL_MAP_FILE
+ If a status, tracker, priority, or custom_field name in a Redmine ticket is NOT found in the map, that name value will NOT be moved to GitHub
+ The map file is "dumb." If you would like to map more than one status name to a single status label, simply repeat it.
    + In the example below, the "redmine_name"s "In Design" and "In Dev" are _both_ mapped to the label named "Status 3: In Design/Dev"
    + For repeated github_label_names, make sure they're the same:)
```csv
redmine_type, redmine_name, github_label_name, github_label_color
status, In Design, Status 3: In Design/Dev,996600
status, In Dev, Status 3: In Design/Dev,996600
``` 

+ When the map is read, the values are trimmed.  e.g. ",    In Design ," would become "In Design" with leading/trailing spaces removed
